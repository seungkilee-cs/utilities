Analysing the Efficiency of `obsidian-index.py`

# Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the code can be analyzed as follows:

## Traversing the Directory Structure:
The code traverses the directory structure recursively to analyze the folders and files.
The time complexity of traversing the directory structure is O(n), where n is the total number of directories and files in the Obsidian vault.

## Generating the README Content:
For each file in the vault, the code checks if it is a directory or a markdown file.
If it is a directory, the code recursively generates the index content for that directory.
If it is a markdown file, the code appends its information to the index content.
The time complexity of generating the index content is also O(n), where n is the total number of directories and files in the Obsidian vault.

## Creating the README File:
Once the index content is generated, the code creates a README file and writes the content to it.
Creating the README file and writing the content has a time complexity of O(1).

Overall, the time complexity of the code is O(n), where n is the total number of directories and files in the Obsidian vault.

# Space Complexity:
The space complexity of the code can be analyzed as follows:

## Recursive Function Calls:
The code uses recursion to traverse the directory structure and generate the index content.
The depth of recursion depends on the depth of the directory structure.
The space complexity of recursive function calls is O(d), where d is the maximum depth of the directory structure.
Index Content and README File:
The code stores the index content in a string variable and writes it to the README file.
The space complexity for storing the index content and the README file is O(n), where n is the total number of directories and files in the Obsidian vault.
## Other Variables:
The code uses additional variables to store file paths, file names, and other temporary data.
The space complexity of these variables is negligible compared to the overall space complexity.
Overall, the space complexity of the code is O(n + d), where n is the total number of directories and files in the Obsidian vault and d is the maximum depth of the directory structure.

## Scalability:
The code's scalability depends on the number of directories and markdown files in the Obsidian vault. As the number of directories and files increases, the time complexity of the code remains linear, O(n), where n is the total number of directories and files. Similarly, the space complexity also increases linearly with the number of directories and files, O(n + d), where n is the total number of directories and files, and d is the maximum depth of the directory structure.

Therefore, the code is scalable and can handle large Obsidian vaults efficiently. However, keep in mind that extremely large vaults with a significantly deep directory structure may require more memory due to the recursive function calls.
